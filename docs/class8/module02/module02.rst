301 Objectives covered: 
   - 1.01 - 1.05
       - Determine which configuration objects are necessary to optimally deploy an application
       - Determine whether or not an application can be deployed with only the LTM module provisioned
       - Identify the difference between deployments (e.g., one arm, two arm, npath, Direct Server Return/DSR)
       - Choose correct profiles and settings to fit application requirements
       - Choose virtual server type and load balancing type to fit application requirements
       - 
       - 
       - Given a scenario, determine the minimum profiles for an application
       - Given an application configuration, determine which functions can
         be offloaded to the LTM device
       - Given iRule functionality, determine the profiles and
         configuration options necessary to implement the iRule.
       - Given application requirements, determine the appropriate profile
         and persistence settings.
