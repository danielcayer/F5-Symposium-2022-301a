Lab 5 - SSL
==============

You will use iApps templates, iRules and an analytics profile to build
new virtual servers that will be used to test Application Visibility and
Reporting (aka Analytics). In interest of time and to avoid typing
errors the iRules and Data Groups have been predefined.

In this module, you will go over the basics of importing/creating certificates and building virtual servers that can encrypt and decrypt traffic.

301a Objectives covered: 
   - 1.10 - 1.11
       - Given a basic iRule's functionality, determine the profiles and configuration options necessary to implement the iRule
       - Describe how to deploy applications using iApp templates
       - 
       - 
       - Given a set of application SSL requirements, determine the
         appropriate profiles and profile options
       - Given a scenario determine the steps required to maintain SSL
         certificates

Estimated completion time: **30 minutes**
